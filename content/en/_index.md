# Welcome!

I'm Cássio, a Cloud & DevOps Engineer in development, specializing in automation and cloud infrastructure. I have experience with AWS, Azure, GCP, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible to build scalable and automated environments. I develop CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and work with monitoring and observability tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, ELK/EFK, and CloudWatch.

I'm focused on delivering efficient, modern, and reliable solutions as I advance my full transition into Cloud/DevOps.
