# Welcome!

Hi, I’m Cássio — a Cloud and DevOps Engineer in development, passionate about automation, cloud architecture, and building reliable, scalable systems. Although I currently work as a bilingual support analyst, I’ve been dedicating my career to mastering modern cloud engineering through practical projects, structured studies, and hands-on experimentation.

I work extensively with AWS, Azure, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes (including Helm), Terraform, and Ansible, applying these tools to create automated, reproducible, and resilient environments. I also build CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and have experience integrating GitLab with Jenkins for automated builds, releases, and deployments across development, staging, and production.

My technical background includes Shell scripting, Python, and Terraform for provisioning, automation tooling, and cloud-environment migration. I’m familiar with microservices architecture, networking fundamentals, Linux/Windows systems, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle. I also work with monitoring and observability stacks like Grafana, ELK/EFK, Zabbix, and CloudWatch to ensure system performance and reliability.

I’m currently pursuing a full transition into Cloud/DevOps engineering, aiming to design and automate efficient, modern, and scalable cloud solutions.
